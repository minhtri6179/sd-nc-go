# Factory Method

- Context: -> Duck
- Strategy interface
- Concrete Strategy 1 ->
- Concrete Strategy 2
- Concrete Strategy 2

## SimUDuck

## Note from this pattern

- Separating what changes from what stays the same
- Programming to an interface instead of programming to implementation
  - `Dog d = new Dog()`
  - `d.bark()`
  - -> `a = getAnimal();`
  - -> `a.makeSound();`
- d
